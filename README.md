MARKET BASKET ANALYSIS USING PYTHON
Performed by : Mohammad Faisal Danish
Start with importing the libraries required to perform the Market Basket Analysis(i.e. MBA)
we would be needing Numpy and Pandas for basic Data Cleaning and Data Preparation
we would be needing Matplotlib for visualizing the market distribution
finally, we would be required to install "APRIORI" library to perform the MBA (use ''' pip install apyori ''')
Let's import all these and get started with data cleaning
